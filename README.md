To-Do List Project
Authors: Noah Anderson, Adam Harvey, Adwith Maple, Ryan Schmidt

Overview:
The To-Do List application was designed to make organizing a list of tasks and deadlines easier. The To-Do list application allows
tasks to be sorted by deadline, name, and priority. Additionally, To-Do lists can be saved and reopened later, as well as saved in
plain text formats for easy access. The To-Do List application runs in Java and requires the most recent version of Java to be run.
